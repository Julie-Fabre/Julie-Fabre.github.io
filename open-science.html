        <h1>Open Science</h1>

        <p>I think science works better when the tools are shared. During my PhD I kept building software to solve problems in my own data, and realised other people were hitting the same walls &mdash; so I made the tools open-source, documented them properly, and tried to get the word out.</p>

        <p>That has grown into something I care about beyond just my own work. I review for the <a href="https://joss.theoj.org/" target="_blank">Journal of Open Source Software</a>, I received an honourable mention for the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/library/open-science-research-support/open-science/ucl-open-science-awards" target="_blank">UCL Open Science Award</a> in 2023 and helped organise it the following year, I run workshops on how to build good research software, and I <a href="https://blogs.ucl.ac.uk/open-access/2024/08/27/open-source-software-design-for-academia/" target="_blank">write about it</a> when I can.</p>

            <h2>BombCell</h2>

            <p>Neuropixels probes can record hundreds of neurons at once, but figuring out which spikes belong to which neuron is messy. Spike sorting algorithms do a first pass, but the results need quality control: are these spikes from a real neuron, or an artifact? From one neuron, or a mix of several? Is the neuron being reliably detected? The standard answer has been to check each unit by hand &mdash; hours of work per experiment, highly subjective, and nearly impossible to reproduce across labs.</p>

            <p>BombCell automates this. It computes quality metrics for every unit and classifies them into single units, multi-units, noise, and non-somatic units. No manual curation needed. It also makes experiments possible that were previously impractical, like tracking neural activity across days while an animal learns a task.</p>

            <p>BombCell is now used in over forty labs worldwide and has been recognised with a $25,000 MathWorks grant. It is available in MATLAB and Python, and we are integrating it into <a href="https://github.com/SpikeInterface" target="_blank">SpikeInterface</a>. I teach it every year in the <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/neuropixels/training" target="_blank">UCL Neuropixels course</a>, which has had thousands of attendees.</p>

            <h2>Brain Street View</h2>

            <p>The Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas is an incredible dataset &mdash; thousands of tracer injections mapping long-range projections across the entire mouse brain. But actually loading and exploring that data programmatically is surprisingly cumbersome.</p>

            <p>Brain Street View makes it easy. It lets you pull connectivity data from the Allen API in MATLAB and visualise projection pathways between brain regions, so you can quickly answer questions like <q>where does this region project to?</q> or <q>what are the inputs to this area?</q></p>
