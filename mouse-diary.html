    <h2 class="diary-title">The Mouse's Diary</h2>
    <p class="diary-subtitle">Found under the floorboards of a suspiciously interactive room</p>

    <div class="diary-entry">
        <h3>Day 1</h3>
        <p>Moved in today. The rent is free and there's a loose plank for easy access. The human seems nice, if a bit obsessed with brains.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="diary-entry">
        <h3>Day 12</h3>
        <p>The human spent 6 hours staring at squiggly lines on her monitor. She called them <q>spikes.</q> They looked nothing like spikes. I've seen spikes. The cat next door has spikes. These are just wiggly lines.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="diary-entry">
        <h3>Day 23</h3>
        <p>She brought home shoes today. Handmade. I tried one on while she was sleeping. It was enormous. Left a tiny footprint inside. She'll never know.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="diary-entry">
        <h3>Day 34</h3>
        <p>Something troubling. She has a poster about <q>basal ganglia.</q> I don't know what ganglia are but they sound like a type of cheese. I'm going to investigate tonight.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="diary-entry">
        <h3>Day 41</h3>
        <p>Ganglia are not cheese. They are not cheese at all. I don't want to talk about it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="diary-entry">
        <h3>Day 47</h3>
        <p>The human clicked the plank again. I played dead. She bought it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="diary-entry">
        <h3>Day 58</h3>
        <p>The jar creatures are fermenting again. The bubbling keeps me up at night. I've named them: Gerald, Bertha, and The Blob. Gerald is my favourite. He has the most consistent bubble rhythm.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="diary-entry">
        <h3>Day 63</h3>
        <p>She keeps folding pieces of leather into shapes. Today she made a handbag. I could live in that handbag. I am considering it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="diary-entry">
        <h3>Day 72</h3>
        <p>Disaster. She got a Tintin rocket on the shelf. Spent the whole night inspecting it before I realised it couldn't actually launch. My heart is still racing.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="diary-entry">
        <h3>Day 89</h3>
        <p>The lamp went off. Finally, my time to explore. I found crumbs on the desk. Premium crumbs. The artisan kind. She must be eating something fancy up there.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="diary-entry">
        <h3>Day 103</h3>
        <p>She turned the lamp back on. I wasn't ready. Froze mid-crumb. We made eye contact. Neither of us has mentioned it since.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="diary-entry">
        <h3>Day 115</h3>
        <p>Someone keeps looking at me through a glowing rectangle. They move a little arrow around and sometimes it hovers RIGHT OVER MY HIDING SPOT. I don't like it. I don't like it at all.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="diary-entry">
        <h3>Day 127</h3>
        <p>The plant on the shelf got bigger today. Nobody watered it. I am suspicious. I have drawn a diagram of possible plant-related conspiracies on the back of this page.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="diary-entry">
        <h3>Day 134</h3>
        <p>The drawer opened by itself. Inside: an old paper. I read it. I understood none of it. There were graphs. One of them had error bars. I don't know what error bars are but they seem important to humans.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="diary-entry">
        <h3>Day 152</h3>
        <p>She closed the curtains today. It got very dark. Then she opened them again. Then closed them. Then opened. I think this is some kind of experiment. I am the control group.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="diary-entry">
        <h3>Day 168</h3>
        <p>Good news: found the coffee mug unattended. Bad news: it was empty. Someone drank it all. Suspects: the human (primary), Gerald (unlikely but not impossible).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="diary-entry">
        <h3>Day 181</h3>
        <p>I have been here for half a year. The floorboard is still loose. The human still hasn't fixed it. I am beginning to think she leaves it loose on purpose. For me. I choose to believe this.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="diary-entry">
        <h3>Day 195</h3>
        <p>There's a clock on the wall now. It ticks. All day. All night. Tick tick tick. I have filed a formal complaint (chewed a small corner of the baseboard).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="diary-entry">
        <h3>Day 210</h3>
        <p>If you are reading this, you found my diary. Please do not tell the human. She thinks this is her office. It is also my office. We are colleagues. She just doesn't know it yet.</p>
